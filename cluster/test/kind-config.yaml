# KIND cluster configuration for local e2e testing of provider-kind.
# extraMounts makes the host Docker socket available inside the KIND node so
# that pods running in the cluster (specifically the provider-kind pod) can
# mount it as a hostPath volume and reach the Docker daemon to create/delete
# KIND clusters.
